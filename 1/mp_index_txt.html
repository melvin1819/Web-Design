      <h1>Welcome</h1>

      <p>
         Mobile Panini is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen Dolcini, who came to America looking to
         serve people the authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
      </p>

      <p>
         Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
         learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
         technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
         Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
         worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
         fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
         graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.
      </p>

      <p>
         Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
         your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.
         We've partnered with Curbside Thai to bring you the finest cuisine on
         four wheels - from the East and the West!
